title: The Ultimate MDX Component Showcase
date: 2024-05-21
---

Welcome to a live demonstration of custom MDX components. This document showcases everything from basic text styling to complex, interactive elements, all rendered through a custom component map.

The `mdx-components.tsx` file provides a rich set of components to style your content and build interactive documentation. Let's explore them.

---

## Typography & Text Elements

The foundation of any document is its text. All heading levels from `h1` to `h6` are custom styled.

### H3: Digging Deeper

This is an `h3` heading, perfect for sub-sections.

#### H4: Even Deeper

And an `h4` for more specific points.

Here is a blockquote, for quoting important information:

> The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.

And here are some lists.

**Unordered List:**

- Item 1: Apples
- Item 2: Oranges
- Item 3: Pears

**Ordered List:**

1. First, do this.
2. Second, do that.
3. Third, you're done!

## Code Blocks with Copy Button

You can have `inline code` snippets. For larger blocks, use a fenced code block with a language and a `filename` to enable the copy button and source link.

```tsx filename="src/components/hello-world.tsx"
import * as React from "react";

// This is a simple React component
export function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

```bash filename="install-script.sh"
# This is a shell script example
pnpm add @tailwindcss/typography@next
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Informational Components

Use alerts and callouts to draw attention to important information.

<Alert>
  <AlertTitle>Heads Up!</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    This is an alert component. You can use it to notify users about something
    important.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

<br />

<Alert variant="destructive">
  <AlertTitle>Action Required</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Your subscription has expired. Please update your billing information to
    continue service.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

<br />

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  This is a callout with a custom emoji, perfect for bright ideas and pro tips!
</Callout>

## Interactive Components

MDX allows for powerful interactive components right inside your content.

### Accordion

<Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full">
  <AccordionItem value="item-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>Is it accessible?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Yes. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern for accessibility.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="item-2">
    <AccordionTrigger>Is it styled?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Yes. It comes with default styles that match the other components'
      aesthetic.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Tabs

<Tabs defaultValue="react" className="w-full">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="react">React</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="vue">Vue</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="react">
    This is the content for the React tab. You can put any MDX content here,
    including other components like code blocks or alerts.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="vue">
    This is the content for the Vue tab. It's a great way to organize
    information.
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Step-by-Step Guides

The `Steps` and `Step` components are great for creating tutorials.

<Steps>
  <Step>Clone the Repository</Step>

This is the first step. You need to get the code on your local machine to get started.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui.git
```

{" "}

<Step>Install Dependencies</Step>

Next, navigate into the directory and install the required packages using your favorite package manager.

```bash
cd ui && pnpm install
```

{" "}

<Step>Run the Development Server</Step>

Now you're ready to start the development server and see the magic happen.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

</Steps>

## Cards and Links

You can use cards to link to other pages or display content in a structured way.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 not-prose">
  <Card>
    <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">A Simple Card</h3>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">This is a simple card component that can contain any MDX content, but it isn't a link.</p>
  </Card>

  <LinkedCard href="/posts">
    <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">View All Posts</h3>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">This whole card is a link. Clicking anywhere on it will navigate you to the main posts page.</p>
  </LinkedCard>
</div>

## Images and Media

Here is a standard markdown image, which maps to the `img` component.

And here is the custom Next.js `Image` component, which provides optimization benefits.

<Image
  src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506744038136-46273834b3fb?q=80&w=1280"
  width={1280}
  height={854}
  alt="A majestic landscape with mountains and a lake"
/>

You can also use `AspectRatio` to maintain a specific ratio for media.

<AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9} className="bg-muted mt-6">
  <Image
    src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1588345921523-c2dcdb7f1dcd?w=800&q=80"
    alt="A beautiful watercolor background"
    fill
    className="rounded-md object-cover"
  />
</AspectRatio>
